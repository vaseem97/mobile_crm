# Connectivity Implementation Guide

This document explains the connectivity implementation in our app, which uses both `connectivity_plus` and `internet_connection_checker` packages for reliable network status detection.

## Architecture

The connectivity solution is implemented with the following components:

1. **ConnectivityService** - Core service that manages connectivity state
2. **ConnectivityAware** - Mixin for repositories to easily add connectivity checks
3. **ConnectivityUtils** - Helper utilities for error handling and UI
4. **ConnectivityBanner** - UI component to show network status

## App-Wide Implementation

Connectivity checking has been implemented across the entire app at various levels:

### Core Services Layer

All network-dependent services now include connectivity checks:

1. **FirebaseAuthService** - All authentication operations
2. **FirestoreService** - All Firestore database operations
3. **StorageService** - All Supabase storage operations
4. **CloudinaryService** - All image upload operations

### Repository Layer

Key repositories implement the ConnectivityAware mixin:

1. **CustomerRepositoryImpl** - All customer-related operations
2. **RepairRepositoryImpl** - All repair-related operations

### How Connectivity is Checked

1. **Before Network Operations**: Every Firebase, Firestore, Cloud Storage, and API call is wrapped with a connectivity check
2. **UI Feedback**: The ConnectivityBanner automatically shows the network status
3. **Exception Handling**: Network-related errors are caught and presented consistently

### Key Functions Added

The following operations now check for connectivity:

- **Authentication**: Login, registration, password reset, profile updates
- **Repair Management**: Creating, updating, and deleting repair records 
- **Customer Management**: Managing customer information
- **Image Upload**: Uploading images for repair records
- **File Storage**: All storage operations

## Features

- Real-time connectivity status monitoring
- Visual indication of network status
- Automatic connectivity checking before network operations
- Centralized connectivity error handling
- Repository-level connectivity awareness with minimal code

## Implementation Details

### ConnectivityService

The `ConnectivityService` uses a two-layer approach to detect connectivity:

1. First layer: `connectivity_plus` to detect if the device has a network connection (WiFi, cellular, etc.)
2. Second layer: `internet_connection_checker` to verify actual internet connectivity by checking multiple endpoints

This approach ensures we're not just checking if WiFi is on, but if we can actually reach the internet.

### How to Use in Repository

```dart
// Add ConnectivityAware mixin to your repository
class MyRepository with ConnectivityAware {
  
  // Use executeWithConnectivity wrapper
  Future<List<MyData>> getData() async {
    return executeWithConnectivity(() async {
      // This code only runs if there is internet connectivity
      // If there's no connectivity, ConnectivityException is thrown
      final response = await _apiClient.fetchData();
      return response.data;
    });
  }
}
```

### Error Handling in UI

```dart
try {
  final data = await _myRepository.getData();
  // Handle successful data
} catch (e) {
  ConnectivityUtils.handleConnectivityError(context, e);
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

You can configure additional addresses for the internet connection checker in the `main.dart` file:

```dart
// Configure the internet connection checker with additional addresses
connectivityService.configureConnectionChecker(
  addresses: [
    // Google DNS
    AddressCheckOptions(
      address: InternetAddress('8.8.8.8'),
      port: 53,
      timeout: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    ),
    // Add more addresses as needed
  ],
);
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use `executeWithConnectivity` for network operations
2. Use the `ConnectivityBanner` widget at the root of your page to show connectivity status
3. Use `ConnectivityUtils.handleConnectivityError` to consistently handle connectivity errors
4. Implement offline-first functionality for critical features using Hive
